# RapportSysteem
Creating a report grading system


This will be my practice project. 
The challenge. Start simple and updrage the codes.

Task: Create a grading systeem for a school & storing the information in a database. 
Entering a grade per student per subject.
   
vx1.
In this version main.py does the basic of adding a grade to a name for the chosen subject.
Every time you run the program it creates a new row in the database.

improvements: check if a student already exists and update the grades instead of creating a new row in the database.
Asking the user if he/she is finished grading before exiting. 
Return and confirm the updated grades.
