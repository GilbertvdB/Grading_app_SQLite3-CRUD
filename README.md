# RapportSysteem
This will be my practice project. 
Creating a report grading system

</br>The challenge is to start simple and updrage the codes.
</br> And as im learning more about programming and development make changes that reflect what i've learned.

</br>Task: Create a grading systeem for a school & storing the information in a database. 
</br>Entering a grade per student per subject.

</br> With every new iteration or new branch I wont merge it with the main. This way I can look at my own progress over time as I learn
</br>more techniques. The last branch is the most updated version so far.

vx4.
Docstrings & comments has been added to the files. 

More and more I'm reading and learning about real world application and coding. One thing that stands out is how you write your code is of equal importance.
Whever possible stick to simple codes. The focus should not only be on a working program but also one that is easy to read and follow. Codes will be expanded or updated either by yourself or someone else. In this version I've made a few changes in this regard.

This version offers to view a students report card. And allows for the adding of more subjects to the database.

improvements:
</br>Display the full name of a subject in the report card. Perhabs by creating a seperate databasee. 
</br>Expand the database to include more information of a student. (name, last name, date of birth)
</br> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</br>

vx2.
In this version main.py performs a name data check before adding or updating grades.
After an update the new updates are shown.
The user has more options after an update is performed. i.e making another udate.

improvements:
</br>Add an option to add more subjects. In real life the is more then one or two subjects.
</br>Add an option to view the repord card of a student.
</br> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</br>

vx1.

In this version main.py does the basic of adding a grade to a name for the chosen subject.
Every time you run the program it creates a new row in the database.

improvements: 
</br>Check if a student already exists and update the grades instead of creating a new row in the database.
</br>Return and confirm the updated grades.
</br>Asking the user if he/she is finished grading before exiting.
