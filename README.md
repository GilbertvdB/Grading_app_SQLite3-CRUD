improvements:
</br>Display the full name of a subject in the report card. Perhabs by creating a seperate databasee. 
</br>Expand the database to include more information of a student. (name, last name, date of birth)

vx2.
In this version main.py performs a name data check before adding or updating grades.
After an update the new updates are shown.
The user has more options after an update is performed. i.e making another udate.

improvements:
</br>Add an option to add more subjects. In real life the is more then one or two subjects.
</br>Add an option to view the repord card of a student.


vx1.

In this version main.py does the basic of adding a grade to a name for the chosen subject.
Every time you run the program it creates a new row in the database.

improvements: 
</br>Check if a student already exists and update the grades instead of creating a new row in the database.
</br>Return and confirm the updated grades.
</br>Asking the user if he/she is finished grading before exiting.
