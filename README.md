Vx4

Docstrings and comments has been added.

As I'm learning more and more about programming and how its done in real world. I keep coming accross the information that your code should be readable by a human.
And whenever possible simple codes. That the focus should not only be on a working program but also an easy to read and follow code and structure.
In the next update I want reflect these changes. And make the program more readable. So that anybody could understand what it does by just reading the code.
